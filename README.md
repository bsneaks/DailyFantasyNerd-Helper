Scripts to assist with Daily Fantasy nerd to save time submitting and modifying lineups eliminating the neeed to do vlookups

When Downloading the Fanduel CSV for NBA it must be renamed FANDUEL-NBA.csv, and the DFN Lineups must be saved as DAILYFANTASYNERD-NBA.csv. It honestly doesnt matter, but i am appending the sport names for the time being as new directories 
specific for NBA, NFL, MLB and CFB will be added.

Also because of how Pandas indexes Dataframes you will need to add text to Cell AB1 (will add that to the code in the future)

(WORK IN PROGRESS)
