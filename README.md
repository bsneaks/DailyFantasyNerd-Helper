**FOR FANDUEL ONLY AT THIS TIME**

Scripts to assist with Daily Fantasy nerd to save time submitting and modifying lineups eliminating the neeed to do vlookups

When Downloading the Fanduel CSV for NBA it must be renamed FANDUEL-NBA.csv, and the DFN Lineups must be saved as DAILYFANTASYNERD-NBA.csv. It honestly doesnt matter what you save it as as long as the csv title matches the code but i built this 
for NBA for now.
 
Future Directories specific for NBA, NFL, MLB and CFB will be added.
